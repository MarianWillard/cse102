    <h2>Commodore 64 Problem</h2>

    <p>Back in the 1980s, a popular type of computer was the Commodore 64 or
    C64. They were 8-bit computers and had 64 kilobytes of RAM (Random Access
    Memory), thus the 64. These computers would also use external floppy disks
    for storing data or programs. Double-sided Commodore 64 floppy disks could
    hold 360 kilobytes.</p><img alt="Commodore 64 floppy disk" src=

    <p>Similar to what our computers use now, the Commodores could connect to
    the internet using Commodore modems. The modem below is a Commodore 64 1660
    modem. This is a 300-baud modem meaning its download speed is about 300
    bits per second.</p><img alt="Commodore 64 1660 Modem" src="1660.gif"

    <p>In June 2006, the Blu-ray Disc was offficaly released. Dual-layer
    Blu-ray discs hold roughly 50 gigabytes of data. This is a huge amount of
    data compared to the Commodore technology.</p><img alt="Blu-ray Disc" src=

    <p>So, here is a question: Using the old Commodore technology mentioned
    above, how long would it take to download a Blu-ray's worth of data, and
    how many floppy disks would be needed to store that data? Sounds fun, let's
    take a look.</p>

    <p>Let's start with the capacity question. Blu-rays hold 50 gigabytes which
    is 50 billion bytes. The Commodore floppy disks can hold 360 kilobytes,
    which is 360 thousand bytes.</p>

    <p>So, we divide 50 billion bytes by 360 thousand bytes:</p>

    <p>&emsp;50,000,000,000 bytes / 360,000 bytes = 138888.888...</p>

    <p>We get a repeating number. Round that up to an integer and the number of
    floppies needed is:</p>

    <h3>&emsp;138,889 floppy disks</h3>

    <p>1 Blu-ray roughly equals 138,889 Commodore 64 floppy disks. That's a lot
    of disks.</p><br>

    <p>Now let's work the time problem. Blu-rays hold 50 billion bytes and the
    1660 modem downloads at 300 bits per second. With a byte equal to 8 bits,
    50 billion bytes to bits is:</p>

    <p>&emsp;50,000,000,000 bytes * 8 bits per byte = 400,000,000,000 bits</p>

    <p>400 billion bits. Divide 400 billion bits by 300 bits per second to find
    seconds...</p>

    <p>&emsp;400,000,000,000 bits / 300 bits per sec = 1,333,333,333
    seconds</p>

    <p>Convert that number to hours, minutes, and seconds:</p>

    <p>&emsp;1,333,333,333 sec / 3600 sec per hour = 370370 r1333 hours</p>

    <p>&emsp;1333 sec / 60 sec per min = 22 minutes 13 seconds</p>

    <p>Divide the hours by 24 to find how many days:</p>

    <p>&emsp;370370 hours / 24 hours per day = 15432 days 2 hours</p>

    <p>Divide days by 365 to find years:</p>

    <p>&emsp;15432 days / 365 days per year = 42 years 102 days</p>

    <p>So, the final answer is:</p>

    <h3>&emsp;42 years 102 days 2 hours 22 minutes 13 seconds</h3>

    <p>That is a really long time. Almost half a century.</p><br>
